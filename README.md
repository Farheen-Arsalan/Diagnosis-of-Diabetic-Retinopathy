# Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy

The existing methods for detecting and grading Diabetic Retinopathy often rely on subjective assessments and extensive manual labor, leading to inefficiencies and potential inconsistencies in diagnosis. Moreover, the increasing prevalence of diabetes and the limited availability of ophthalmologists further exacerbate the challenges in timely screening and diagnosis. Therefore, there is a need to develop a robust and reliable automated system that can accurately detect and grade diabetic retinopathy, enabling early intervention and personalized treatment plans.
